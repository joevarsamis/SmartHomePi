# SmartHomePi
Smart home using a raspberryPi 3 model b and a GrovePi kit, which allows you to check temperature, luminosity, humidity and noise.
It also allows you to control the radiator and the lights. Moreover, the temperature and humidity sensor collect data both from inside 
your home and from official weather server which allows the pi to preheat your home if the forecast is due to be low in temperature. 
Finally, the kit is connected with two cameras wich are meant to detect movement inside the house and if motion is detected or not, 
lights and/or radiator are automatically turned on or off in every case scenario. The project is coded using python.
